## Project Overview

This project aims to improve the early detection of cardiac abnormalities by analyzing ECG signals using advanced deep learning techniques. The developed model processes ECG data, identifies potential anomalies, and provides interpretable results that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing heart conditions.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Features

- Processes over 1 million ECG samples, demonstrating ability to handle large-scale medical data
- Achieves 95% accuracy in detecting five different types of cardiac abnormalities
- Implements a novel hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for improved temporal feature extraction
- Utilizes an attention mechanism for increased model interpretability
- Validates performance across multiple independent ECG datasets

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecg-anomaly-detection.git
cd ecg-anomaly-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/ecg/data --epochs 100
```

To evaluate the model on new data:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved/model --data_path /path/to/test/data
```

## Model Architecture

The model uses a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. This combination allows for effective spatial feature extraction from ECG signals while capturing temporal dependencies.

Key components:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- LSTM layers for sequence modeling
- Attention mechanism for interpretability
- Autoencoder structure for anomaly detection

## Results

- 95% accuracy in detecting five types of cardiac abnormalities
- 40% reduction in model inference time, enabling real-time analysis
- 30% reduction in false positive rate
- Consistent >90% accuracy across three independent ECG datasets

## Future Work

- Integrate the model with real-time ECG monitoring systems
- Expand the range of detectable cardiac abnormalities
- Develop a user-friendly interface for medical professionals
- Conduct clinical trials to further validate the model's performance
